				<h3>Our Objectives<br><span class="japanese">方針</span></h3>
				<p>The Japan Society of Northern Ireland is an entirely voluntary organization established on 17th September 1996 to promote a greater understanding within N. Ireland of Japan and its people, culture and language and to generally foster greater communication between both countries.</p>
				<h3>Our Events<br><span class="japanese">イベント</span></h3>
				<p>JSNI has organized and promoted a variety of events, cultural, educational and social. These have included the first ever Nihon Buyo performance in N. Ireland, a Koto concert, Japanese tea ceremony, Ikebana and calligraphy workshops, Kimono and Japanese cookery demonstrations and seminars on doing business with Japan. Other events include family picnics, Christmas parties, New Year dinners and pub nights.</p>
				<p>JSNI was instrumental in ensuring participation by a group of Northern Irish companies at the British Lifestyle Exhibition in Tokyo as part of Festival UK ’98 in Japan. JSNI also organized the Japan 2001 Mini-Matsuri (festival) at the Hillsborough International Oyster Festival and one in Bangor in 2003.</p>
				<h3>Membership<br><span class="japanese">メンバーシップ</span></h3>
				<p>New members are always welcome. Membership of JSNI is open to anyone living in N. Ireland with an interest in Japan. Membership is for one year and is renewed annually at the end of September..</p>
